add lesson option overrides that can override all user/lesson options

fix user_ prefix in user_wordlist

lesson/series selection

add length property to measure word progress

add adaptive option

in char mode count space as a character
  how to handle optional space??



adaptive list must process word state for typos
track first word error separately than all word errors
series
how to manage random and adaptive in config - cant use both at same time
  add a LessonFormState type and have form state keep an array of them
  each lesson class sets form state
  each time config is changed run set state for all lesson wrappers
  and/or use present | disabled for wrapper class state
custom word lists
max word history
multilingual example text
shift unpauses
